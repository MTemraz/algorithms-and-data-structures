# Question: Write a function that takes two parameters n and k and returns the value of Binomial Coefficient C(n, k). For example, your function should return 6 for n = 4 and k = 2, and it should return 10 for n = 5 and k = 2.

def binomial(n,k):
    C = [[0]*(k+1) for _ in range(n+1)]
    for i in range(n+1):
        C[i][1] = 1
    for i in range(n+1):
        for j in range(i):
            C[i][j] = C[i-1][]
