# Question: Given an array of n positive integers. Write a program to find the sum of maximum sum subsequence of the given array such that the intgers in the subsequence are sorted in increasing order.

# Example:
#    Input: [1, 101, 2, 3, 100, 4, 5]
#    Output: 106, formed by [1 + 2 + 3 + 100]
#
#    Input: [3, 4, 5, 10]
#    Output: 22, formed by [3 + 4 + 5 + 10]
#
#    Input: [10, 5, 4, 3]
#    Output: 10, formed by [10]

    cache = array
    for i in range(len(array)):
        for j in range(i):
            if array[i] > array[j]:
                cache[i] = max(cache[i], cache[j]+array[i])
